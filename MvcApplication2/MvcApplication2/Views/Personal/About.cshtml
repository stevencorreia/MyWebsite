        <p>
            I hope this finds you in the best of things.
        </p>
        <p>
            I completed my masters in computer science from Kent State University on May 4, 2012. I have completed my bachelors from University of
            Mumbai (India) and graduated in June 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have more than 7 years of professional software development experience on application (web/console) development.
            Currently I am working as an application developer in one of the leading telemarketing company InfoCision.
            Prior to this I used to work as a web developer in residence services department at Kent State University while pursuing my master’s degree.
            Before my masters I worked for 3 years in India as an application developer in a company name Iris business services limited.
            During my work tenure, I had an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with web programming, object oriented programming, version controlling,
            different phases of the software development life-cycle and have always strived to use the most efficient algorithms and easy-to-debug OO designs.
            As a member of a team of experienced programmers I have learned a lot about programming design and techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am very passionate about software development in a dynamic environment where my contribution towards the design and implementation would help to make the product vision a reality.
